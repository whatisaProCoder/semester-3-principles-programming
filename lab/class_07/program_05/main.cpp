/*
Problem 5: Hybrid Inheritance

Statement:
Create a base class Student with roll number and name. Derive class Exam from
Student to store marks of 5 subjects. Derive another class Sports (not from
Student) to store sports marks. Create a class Result that inherits from both
Exam and Sports and displays the total marks.
